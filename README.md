Issue Management is the process of identifying, reporting and resolving all such issues and bugs that may otherwise impair the progress of a project.
The process of managing issues, however, is not always a smooth ride. You have to ensure each issue is adequately reported on time, prioritized, logged into the database and appointed to a suitable person who has the optimum set of skills to fix it. Which is why Project Managers employ the help of an issue management software, and this issue tracker app is here to do this job for free.
This is a fullstack app, using the MERN stack and Material UI. The backend uses GraphQL.
The frontend and backend are deployed on Heroku.
